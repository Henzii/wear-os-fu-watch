# FuWatch
This is a simple, hobby-based disc golf scorekeeping app built for Wear OS. The app is designed to help you keep track of your disc golf scores on your Wear OS watch, making it easier than ever
to record your scores while out on the course. The app is developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, and the data is stored on the FuDisc servers.

Additionally, there's a companion app for disc golf scorekeeping called FuDisc, which is built with React Native. You can check it out on GitHub here: [putt-master-9000](https://github.com/Henzii/putt-master-9000).
The server powering both this Wear OS app and the FuDisc app can be found at [putt-master-9000-server](https://github.com/Henzii/putt-master-9000.)

Note that this is a personal learning project, so the code quality may not be production-ready. It's primarily a fun way to get hands-on experience with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Wear OS development.
